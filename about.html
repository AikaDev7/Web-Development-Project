                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>
                    I am Aiya Bakhitzhanova, a passionate computer science student at Kennesaw State University. 
                    With a strong interest in software engineering, I enjoy creating innovative solutions that blend technology and creativity. 
                    My journey in programming began with a curiosity for problem-solving, which has since grown into a dedication
                    to developing efficient and user-friendly applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout my time at KSU, I have worked on various projects, including a POS system using C#, 
                    interactive games in Pygame, and Java-based applications. Beyond coding, I have explored 
                    photography, music, and design, which contribute to my ability to approach technical challenges with 
                    a creative mindset. I am always eager to learn new skills and refine my expertise in software development. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Looking forward, I am committed to continuous learning and professional development. I aspire 
                    to become a versatile technology professional who can bridge the gap between innovative ideas 
                    and practical implementation. Whether it's web development, software engineering, or emerging 
                    technologies, I am excited to explore and contribute to the ever-evolving digital landscape.
